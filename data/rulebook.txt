Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital includes ordinary shares and retained earnings.

Banks must maintain a minimum CET1 ratio of 4.5% of risk-weighted assets.

Tier 1 capital consists of CET1 and Additional Tier 1 instruments.

Risk-weighted assets determine the minimum capital requirement.

If exposure exceeds regulatory thresholds, additional capital buffers apply.
